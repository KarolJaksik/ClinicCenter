# MedicalCenter
Console application to booking medical appointments.
## Getting Started 
Unfortunately app is only for windows users.
To test MedicalCenter just download our repo and run the code in your IDE. In case of enormous numer of weird errors try to change Target Platform Version to your available one in project properties.
**Project->Properties->Configuration Properties->General->Target Platform Version**

Rarely Platform Toolcase also require modification.
